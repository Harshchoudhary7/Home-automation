CONCLUSION

The project “IOT BASED HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM” has been successfully 

designed and tested. Integrating features of all the hardware components used have 

developed it. Presence of every module has been reasoned out and placed carefully thus 

contributing to the best working of the unit. Secondly, using highly advanced IC’s and with 

the help of growing technology the project has been successfully implemented.

Embedded systems are emerging as a technology with high potential. In the past 

decades microprocessor based embedded system ruled the market. The last decade 

witnessed the revolution of Microcontroller based embedded systems. With regards to the 

requirements gathered the manual work and the complexity in counting can be achieved 

with the help of electronic devices.
