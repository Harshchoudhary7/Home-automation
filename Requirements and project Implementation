REQUIREMENS
software Requirements :

1. Arduino IDE

You will be needing Arduino IDE software to write and upload the programming 

logic onto the Arduino Uno board

2. Blynk App

Also, you need to create an account in the Blynk app IoT to integrate the working of 

the system physically on the Blynk app

10.2 Hardware Requirements :

1. Power Supply Board

2.  Channel Relay

3. Node MCU (ESP8266)

 Project Implementation

1. An application is installed in the mobile (Blynk).

2. ESP8266 Wi-Fi module used for providing communication between the application 

and system

3. By using this we can switch on or off the lights or fans automatically when we are 

outside

4. Also the notification gets triggered in Blynk app whenever a motion is detected
